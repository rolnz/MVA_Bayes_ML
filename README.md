# MVA_Bayes_ML

Here are some documents for the project of Bayesian machine learning. 

'Data_augmentation_svm_paper.pdf' is the document we are studying. 

It serves as a baseline for 'Data_augmentation_SVM.ipynb'. In this 
document the user is invited to use the Part VI with his own data.

My own report is 'Bayes_ML_ROLAND_NZALA-BACKA_Rapport'

'dataset_fm20' gives a link to the dataset of soccer players.
